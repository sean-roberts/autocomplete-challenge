## Autocomplete input challenge

### To Launch:

- `npm install` - if you have not already done so
- `npm start`
- navigate browser to `http://localhost:35472`


### To Test:
- `npm install` - if you have not already done so
- `npm test`


### Considerations Made
- Decided to use usernames as the primary selection method. It is assumed to be
more unique than actual names and would keep the consistency of how users reference
each other.
